PiranhaPix - Image Scaling Application, Perfect for preparing training data
Project Description
PiranhaPix is a GUI-based Python application that allows users to resize images in bulk. The user-friendly interface enables easy selection of input and output folders, as well as specifying custom image dimensions. The application is built using customtkinter for a modern UI and leverages OpenCV for image processing.

Key Features
✅ Batch Image Scaling – Resize multiple images at once.
✅ Custom Resolution – Users can specify width and height.
✅ Intuitive GUI – Built with customtkinter for a modern look.
✅ Dark Mode UI – Uses a neon cyberpunk design with a Piranha theme.
✅ Standalone EXE Support – Can be compiled into a .exe file using pyinstaller.

Technologies Used
Python 3.12
OpenCV (cv2) – Image processing.
CustomTkinter (customtkinter) – Modern GUI elements.
Tkinter (tkinter) – Native GUI toolkit.
Pillow (PIL) – Image handling for backgrounds.
